# Pygmentalion

An interactive fiction game originally designed to provide an example file for
the syntax highlighter [Pygments](https://pygments.org/).

To play the game, download the artifact from the latest [workflow run](
https://github.com/dscorbett/pygmentalion/actions), or build it from source. For
build instructions, consult .github/workflows/main.yml and Makefile. There are
two images: pygmentalion.t3 (used by most interpreters) and pygmentalion-web.t3
(used by the Web UI). The best interpreter for _Pygmentalion_ is [QTads](
https://realnc.github.io/qtads/#downloads).

Warning: as it is inspired by a medieval French allegory, the game contains some
light nudity and sexual innuendo.
