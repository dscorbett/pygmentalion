  Ivory— Horn— Ivory— You push on the gates separating you from your beloved, but
they do not budge.

Darkness— Light— Darkness— Colors gleam and fade as her wardrobe runs the
gamut, but she remains pale and lifeless.  Though she is a statue carved by
your own hand, you love her more than anything.  If only she could live and
love you too.

You pound again on the ivory gate, and as you do—

You awake in your studio.  Perhaps this is the day your prayers will be
answered.

Studio Entrance
Your studio is where you create great works of art, though you have made
nothing since you carved that statue.  This corner, which now serves as your
bedroom and dining room, is the entrance to the building.  A door leads
outside, and the studio itself is to the north and the east.

You see a camp bed and an end table (on which are a bottle of wine, a plate of
chopped liver, and a coin box) here.

>credit
Credit goes to Pygments for providing the excuse to write this game.  The story
was loosely inspired by a section of “Le Roman de la Rose”.

What/who do you want to pray at/to?

>pray me
Praying to yourself would make the gods jealous.

Aphrodite would not like to be prayed at as if she were an altar.

>x god
A deity can only be interacted with through prayer.

camp bed: It is a narrow portable camp bed.  You brought it into the studio so
you would not have to leave the statue every night.

end table: A small portable table.  On the end table are a bottle of wine, a
plate of chopped liver, and a coin box.

bottle of wine: A bottle of sea-dark wine.

plate of chopped liver: You have been living on chopped liver since you moved
into the studio permanently.  It isn’t bad, but it does get monotonous.

coin box: A small round box in which you keep your coins, when you have any.
It’s closed.

door: It is a simple wooden door.  It’s closed.

>eat liver
You eat all the liver.  The plate will be full again tomorrow morning though.
Somehow, the liver always regenerates overnight.

>x it
It is empty for now.

>give god it
She isn’t here.  You’ll have to leave the plate somewhere she can find it.

>drink

You take a sip and realize that this is not sea-dark wine after all.  It is
just seawater.

That would be disgusting.

>taste it
It tastes salty.

>pour it
That would be wasteful.

>put it in box
(first taking the bottle of seawater, then opening the coin box)
You can only put coins in the coin box.

>x box
A small round box in which you keep your coins, when you have any.  It’s open
and empty.  Maybe next time you check, it will contain a coin.  You can only
hope.

>l in it
It’s empty.  Maybe next time you check, it will contain a coin.  You can only

At the Workbench
This workbench, in the northwest part of the studio, was where you would create
works of art.  Now you just come here to contemplate your creation’s beauty,
dress her up, ply her with gifts, and lament your hopeless situation.

The statue stands on a plinth beside the workbench.

You see a stool here.  On the workbench are a gold nugget, a needle, a chisel,
and an idol.

>scream
You scream as loud as you can.  The statue does not appear to hear you
screaming.

>give me to her
You have already given yourself to her.  You were hers from the moment you
first saw her.

>hug it
You hold the statue in your arms.  The ivory is cold, but as you linger in a
loving embrace, you notice her hand feels different: it has the warmth and
softness of real flesh.  The statue is finally coming to life!

Oh.  That was just your own hand.  Never mind.

You break the silence but hear nothing back.  You don’t know what you were

The statue is as stiff and cold as a post, you know from experience.  It would
be more satisfying if she were alive.  Sorry, but it’s true.

Where did that thought come from?  Even in the worst of your mood swings, you
have never considered harming her.

What would she want with that?

workbench: Your workbench is usually scattered with tools and materials and
half-finished projects.

On the workbench are a gold nugget, a needle, and an idol.

gold nugget: It is a large nugget of gold that sparkles in the light.  You
haven’t decided what to make it into yet.

idol: The idol is a small statuette of Aphrodite carved from meerschaum.

statue: This is a statue of a woman carved from ivory.

She is wearing a [[string]] of pearls.

string of pearls: You put this pearl necklace on the statue yesterday.
plinth: It’s a smoothed block of marble half a cubit high.
stool: A portable folding stool, or diphros okladias.
needle: A sharp tool used for sewing.  It is made of silver.
chisel: A sharp tool used for carving.

Washroom
Sculpting is a dusty business.  You use this sink to clean off after a hard
day’s work.  Beside the sink is a small side table, and on the wall is a
calculator.  The rest of the studio is south and west.

On the side table are a manual and a comb.

>x book
[[Operator]]’s Manual

To control the auto-sink, use the calculator add-on to enter the desired volume
of water.  It supports the standard Thalassa++ unary and binary operations:

   + – addition
   - – subtraction
   * – multiplication
   / – division
   % – modulo
   ~ – bitwise NOT
   ! – logical NOT
   & – bitwise AND
   | – bitwise OR
   ^ – bitwise XOR
   << – shift left
   >> – arithmetic shift right
   >>> – logical shift right

For example,
       CALCULATE 69 TIMES 105
to fill the basin with 7,245 kochliaria.

Warning: Do not use big [[number]]s or divide by zero!

Light from the window illuminates a crude altar.  Until recently, this area was

it anyway.  You are sure the gods will understand.

blank; as an interior [[decorator]], you can’t help but think the wall would
benefit from a bas-relief, but – sigh – you are too lovelorn to wield the
chisel.

“O Aphrodite,” you say, “comforter of hopeless lovers, hear my prayer!  May she
to whom I have given my heart be given body, soul, and life.  And a colorful
personality.  And—”

You are interrupted by a shimmering about the altar.  As you watch, it takes
the form of a callipygian goddess.

“Mortal, I have heard your heart-felt and oft-repeated plea, and I will take
pity on you,” says Aphrodite.  “If you give me a token of your love as an
offering, I will give you the [[keyword]] of life.  Speak this word in the
presence of a mirror, and I will grant your request.”

She fades away, adding, “As for her colorful personality, just look around
you.”

>x her
This is an untitled statue of a woman carved from flawless milk-white ivory.
Her long hair is done up in a chignon, with a few strands falling down her
neck, and she radiates an aura of contrapposto grace.

You wonder what she is going to be like as a living woman.  Maybe she’ll be a
painter and expand your business.  Maybe she’ll have a head for figures and
will put the accounts in order.  She’ll love you, obviously, but beyond that
you don’t know.  If only Aphrodite would bring her to life without this silly
puzzle about tokens and mirrors!

>hug it
You hold the statue in your arms.  The ivory is cold, but as you linger in a
loving embrace, you notice her hand feels different: it has the warmth and
softness of real flesh.  Aphrodite did it!  The statue is finally coming to
life!

Oh.  That was just your own hand.  Never mind.

This is a short game originally designed to provide an example file for the
syntax highlighter Pygments (https://pygments.org/).

Scattered throughout the game are highlighted words corresponding to syntactic
token types.  Finding them increases your score but is not necessary to beat
the game.  Some are easy to find, but these are the [[exception]] rather than
the rule.  Many are hidden and some may become unavailable as the story
progresses.

The command CALCULATE may be abbreviated as C.  For more commands, type HELP.

For hints, PRAY TO IRIS.

(Your score has just increased by one point.)

>help
This is a work of interactive fiction.  Type commands at the prompt to interact
with the fiction.  Basic commands (some of which have abbreviations) include:

   Looking around:
       LOOK (L)
       EXAMINE (X) [object]
       READ [object]
       SEARCH [object]
   Moving around:
       NORTH (N)
       SOUTH (S)
       EAST (E)
       WEST (W)
       UP (U)
       DOWN (D)
   Inventory management:
       INVENTORY (I)
       GET [object]
       DROP [object]
       PUT [object] IN/ON [object]
       WEAR [object]
   Meta commands:
       UNDO
       SAVE
       RESTORE
       QUIT

Other useful verbs should become obvious when necessary.

This particular interactive fiction is an allegorical romance, also known as a
puzzle-based adventure game.  Each word appearing in the story is an allegory.
For example, the word “help” is an allegory for the concept of help.  The story
assumes a basic familiarity with written language so this lesson in semiotics
need not be belabored.

If you are not familiar with written language, then learning to read is your
first puzzle.  Congratulations on making it this far!  Otherwise, most puzzles
involve going to various locations and using various objects.  Some objects
have side effects – for example, the rod scares the bird.

For a much more verbose introduction to interactive fiction, not written for
“Pygmentalion” but part of the TADS 3 standard library, type INSTRUCTIONS.

>instru
The story is about to show a full set of instructions, designed especially for
people who aren’t already familiar with interactive fiction.  The instructions
are lengthy, so you might want to capture them to a file (so that you can print
them out, for example).  Would you like to proceed?
(Y is affirmative, or type SCRIPT to capture to a file) > y

Entering Commands

You’ve probably already noticed that you interact with the story by typing a
command whenever you see the “prompt,” which usually looks like this:


>

Knowing this much, you’re probably thinking one of two things: “Great, I can
type absolutely anything I want, in plain English, and the story will do my
bidding,” or “Great, now I have to figure out yet another heinously complex
command language for a computer program; I think I’ll go play Minesweeper.”
Well, neither extreme is quite true.

In actual play, you’ll only need a fairly small set of commands, and the
commands are mostly in ordinary English, so there’s not very much you’ll have
to learn or remember.  Even though that command prompt can look intimidating,
don’t let it scare you off — there are just a few simple things you have to
know.

First, you’ll almost never have to refer to anything that isn’t directly
mentioned in the story; this is a story, after all, not a guessing game where
you have to think of everything that goes together with some random object.
For example, if you’re wearing a jacket, you might assume that the jacket has
pockets, or buttons, or a zipper — but if the story never mentions those
things, you shouldn’t have to worry about them.

Second, you won’t have to think of every conceivable action you could perform.
The point of the game isn’t to make you guess at verbs.  Instead, you’ll only
have to use a relatively small number of simple, ordinary actions.  To give you
an idea of what we mean, here are some of the commands you can use:

   LOOK AROUND
   INVENTORY
   GO NORTH (or EAST, SOUTHWEST, and so on, or UP, DOWN, IN, OUT)
   WAIT
   TAKE THE BOX
   DROP THE DISK
   LOOK AT THE DISK
   READ THE BOOK
   OPEN BOX
   CLOSE BOX
   LOOK IN THE BOX
   LOOK THROUGH WINDOW
   PUT FLOPPY DISK INTO BOX
   PUT BOX ON TABLE
   WEAR THE CONICAL HAT
   TAKE OFF HAT
   TURN ON LANTERN
   LIGHT MATCH
   LIGHT CANDLE WITH MATCH
   PUSH BUTTON
   PULL LEVER
   TURN KNOB
   TURN DIAL TO 11
   EAT COOKIE
   DRINK MILK
   THROW PIE AT CLOWN
   ATTACK TROLL WITH SWORD
   UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
   LOCK DOOR WITH KEY
   CLIMB THE LADDER
   GET IN THE CAR
   SIT ON THE CHAIR
   STAND ON THE TABLE
   STAND IN FLOWER BED
   LIE ON THE BED
   TYPE HELLO ON COMPUTER
   LOOK UP BOB IN PHONE BOOK
   CALCULATE 69 TIMES 105
   PRAY TO IRIS
   SAY "HAPAX LEGOMENON"

Most of the verbs you’ll need to complete the story are shown above; there
might be a few additional commands you’ll need from time to time as well, but
they’ll follow the same simple format as the commands above.

A few of these commands deserve some more explanation.  LOOK AROUND (which you
abbreviate to LOOK, or even just L) shows the description of the current
location.  You can use this if you want to refresh your memory of your
character’s surroundings.  INVENTORY (or just I) shows a list of everything
your character is carrying.  WAIT (or Z) just lets a little time pass in the
story.

Abbreviations

You’ll probably use a few commands quite a lot, so to save typing, you can
abbreviate some of the most frequently-used commands:

   LOOK AROUND can be shortened to LOOK, or merely L
   INVENTORY can be simply I
   GO NORTH can be written NORTH, or even just N (likewise E, W, S, NE, SE, NW,
SW, U for UP and D for DOWN)
   LOOK AT THE DISK can be entered as EXAMINE DISK or simply X DISK
   WAIT can be shortened to Z

A Few More Command Details

When you’re entering commands, you can use capital or small letters in any
mixture.  You can use words such as THE and A when they’re appropriate, but you
can omit them if you prefer.  You can abbreviate any word to its first six
letters, but if you choose not to abbreviate, the story will pay attention to
everything you actually type; this means, for example, that you can abbreviate
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS to SUPERC or SUPERCAL, but not to SUPERCSDF.

Travel

At any given time in the story, your character is in a “location.”  The story
describes the location when your character first enters, and again any time you
type LOOK.  Each location usually has a short name that’s displayed just before
its full description; the name is useful when drawing a map, and the short name
can help jog your memory as you’re finding your way around.

Each location is a separate room, or a large outdoor area, or the like.
(Sometimes a single physical room is so large that it comprises several
locations in the game, but that’s fairly rare.)  For the most part, going to a
location is as specific as you have to get about travel; once your character is
in a location, the character can usually see and reach everything within the
location, so you don’t have to worry about where exactly your character is
standing within the room.  Once in a while, you might find that something is
out of reach, perhaps because it’s on a high shelf or on the other side of a
moat; in these cases, it’s sometimes useful to be more specific about your
character’s location, such as by standing on something (STAND ON TABLE, for
example).

Traveling from one location to another is usually done using a direction
command: GO NORTH, GO NORTHEAST, GO UP, and so on.  (You can abbreviate the
cardinal and vertical directions to one letter each — N, S, E, W, U, D — and
the diagonal directions to two: NE, NW, SE, SW.)  The story should always tell
you the directions that you can go when it describes a location, so you should
never have to try all the unmentioned directions to see if they go anywhere.

In most cases, backtracking (by reversing the direction you took from one
location to another) will take you back to where you started, although some
passages might have turns.

Most of the time, when the story describes a door or passageway, you won’t need
to open the door to go through the passage, as the story will do this for you.
Only when the story specifically states that a door is blocking your way will
you usually have to deal with the door explicitly.

Manipulating Objects

You might find objects in the story that your character can carry or otherwise
manipulate.  If you want to carry something, type TAKE and the object’s name:
TAKE BOOK.  If you want to drop something your character is carrying, DROP it.

You usually won’t have to be very specific about exactly how your character is
supposed to carry or hold something, so you shouldn’t have to worry about which
hand is holding which item or anything like that.  It might sometimes be useful
to put one object inside or on top of another, though; for example, PUT BOOK IN
SHOPPING BAG or PUT VASE ON TABLE.  If your character’s hands get full, it
might help to put some items being carried into a container, much as in real
life you can carry more stuff if it’s in a bag or a box.

You can often get a lot of extra information (and sometimes vital clues) by
examining objects, which you can do with the LOOK AT command (or, equivalently,
EXAMINE, which you can abbreviate to simply X, as in X PAINTING).  Most
experienced players get in the habit of examining everything in a new location
right away.

Time

Time passes in the story only in response to commands you type.  This means
that nothing happens while the story is waiting for you to type something.
Each command takes about the same amount of time in the story.  If you
specifically want to let some extra time pass within the story, because you
think something is about to happen, you can type WAIT (or just Z).

Saving and Restoring

You can save a snapshot of your current position in the story at any time, so
that you can later restore the story to the same position.  The snapshot will
be saved to a file on your computer’s disk, and you can save as many different
snapshots as you’d like (to the extent you have space on your disk, anyway).

In this story, your character will never be killed, and you’ll never find
yourself in a situation where it’s impossible to complete the story.  Whatever
happens to your character, you’ll always be able to find a way to complete the
story.  So, unlike in many text games, you don’t have to worry about saving
positions to protect yourself against getting stuck in impossible situations.
Of course, you can still save as often as you’d like, to suspend your session
and return to it later, or to save positions that you think you might want to
revisit.

To save your position, type SAVE at the command prompt.  The story will ask you
for the name of a disk file to use to store snapshot.  You’ll have to specify a
filename suitable for your computer system, and the disk will need enough free
space to store the file; you’ll be told if there’s any problem saving the file.
You should use a filename that doesn’t already exist on your machine, because
the new file will overwrite any existing file with the same name.

You can restore a previously saved position by typing RESTORE at any prompt.
The story will ask you for the name of the file to restore.  After the computer
reads the file, everything in the story will be exactly as it was when you
saved that file.

Undo

Even if you haven’t saved your position recently, you can usually take back
your last few commands with the UNDO command.  Each time you type UNDO, the
story reverses the effect of one command, restoring the story as it was before
you typed that command.  UNDO is limited to taking back the last few commands,
so this isn’t a substitute for SAVE/RESTORE, but it’s very handy if you find
your character unexpectedly in a dangerous situation, or you make a mistake you
want to take back.

Some Other Special Commands

The story understands a few other special commands that you might find useful.

AGAIN (or just G): Repeats the last command.  (If your last input line had
several commands, only the last single command on the line is repeated.)

INVENTORY (or just I): Shows what your character is carrying.

LOOK (or just L): Shows the full description of your character’s current
location.

EXITS: Shows the list of obvious exits from the current location.

EXITS ON/OFF/STATUS/LOOK: Controls the way the game displays exit lists.  EXITS
ON puts a list of exits in the status line and also lists exits in each room
description.  EXITS OFF turns off both of these listings.  EXITS STATUS turns
on just the status line exit list, and EXITS ROOM turns on only the room
description lists.

OOPS: Corrects a single misspelled word in a command, without retyping the
entire command.  You can only use OOPS immediately after the story tells you it
didn’t recognize a word in your previous command.  Type OOPS followed by the
corrected word.

QUIT (or just Q): Terminates the story.

RESTART: Starts the story over from the beginning.

RESTORE: Restores a position previously saved with SAVE.

SAVE: Saves the current position in a disk file.

SCRIPT: Starts making a transcript of your story session, saving all of the
displayed text to a disk file, so that you can peruse it later or print it out.

SCRIPT OFF: Ends a transcript that you started with SCRIPT.

UNDO: Takes back the last command.

SAVE DEFAULTS: Saves your current settings for things like NOTIFY, EXITS, and
FOOTNOTES as defaults.  This means that your settings will be restored
automatically the next time you start a new game, or RESTART this one.

RESTORE DEFAULTS: Explicitly restores the option settings you previously saved
with SAVE DEFAULTS.

Unknown Words

The story doesn’t pretend to know every word in the English language.  The
story might even occasionally use words in its own descriptions that it doesn’t
understand in commands.  If you type a command with a word the story doesn’t
know, the story will tell you which word it didn’t recognize.  If the story
doesn’t know a word for something it described, and it doesn’t know any
synonyms for that thing, you can probably assume that the object is just there
as a detail of the setting, and isn’t important to the story.

Ambiguous Commands

If you type a command that leaves out some important information, the story
will try its best to figure out what you mean.  Whenever it’s reasonably
obvious from context what you mean, the story will make an assumption about the
missing information and proceed with the command.  The story will point out
what it’s assuming in these cases, to avoid any confusion from a mismatch
between the story’s assumptions and yours.  For example:

   >TIE THE ROPE
   (to the hook)
   The rope is now tied to the hook.  The end of the
   rope nearly reaches the floor of the pit below.

If the command is ambiguous enough that the story can’t safely make an
assumption, you’ll be asked for more information.  You can answer these
questions by typing the missing information.

   >UNLOCK THE DOOR
   What do you want to unlock it with?

   >KEY
   Which key do you mean, the gold key, or the silver key?

   >GOLD
   Unlocked.

If the story asks you one of these questions, and you decide that you don’t
want to proceed with the original command after all, you can just type in a
brand new command instead of answering the question.

Advanced Command Formats

Once you get comfortable with entering commands, you might be interested to
know about some more complex command formats that the story will accept.  These
advanced commands are all completely optional, because you can always do the
same things with the simpler formats we’ve talked about so far, but experienced
players often like the advanced formats because they can save you a little
typing.

Using Multiple Objects at Once

In most commands, you can operate on multiple objects in a single command.  Use
the word AND, or a comma, to separate one object from another:

   TAKE THE BOX, THE FLOPPY DISK, AND THE ROPE
   PUT DISK AND ROPE IN BOX
   DROP BOX AND ROPE

You can use the words ALL and EVERYTHING to refer to everything applicable to
your command, and you can use EXCEPT or BUT (right after the word ALL) to
exclude specific objects:

   TAKE ALL
   PUT ALL BUT DISK AND ROPE INTO BOX
   TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF THE BOX
   TAKE ALL OFF SHELF

ALL refers to everything that makes sense for your command, excluding things
inside other objects matching the ALL.  For example, if you’re carrying a box
and a rope, and the box contains a floppy disk, typing DROP ALL will drop the
box and the rope, and the floppy will remain in the box.

“It” and “Them”

You can use IT and THEM to refer to the last object or objects that you used in
a command:

   TAKE THE BOX
   OPEN IT
   TAKE THE DISK AND THE ROPE
   PUT THEM IN THE BOX

Multiple Commands At Once

You can put multiple commands on a single input line by separating the commands
with periods or the word THEN, or with a comma or AND.  For example:

   TAKE THE DISK AND PUT IT IN THE BOX
   TAKE BOX.  OPEN IT.
   UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH THE KEY.  OPEN IT, THEN GO NORTH.

If the story doesn’t understand one of the commands, it will tell you what it
couldn’t understand, and ignore everything after that on the line.

A Few Tips

Now that you know the technical details of entering commands, you might be
interested in some strategy pointers.  Here are a few techniques that
experienced interactive fiction players use when approaching a story.

EXAMINE everything, especially when you enter a new location for the first
time.  Looking at objects will often reveal details that aren’t mentioned in
the broader description of the location.  If examining an object mentions
detailed parts of the object, examine them as well.

Make a map, if the story has more than a few locations.  When you encounter a
new location for the first time, note all of its exits; this will make it easy
to see at a glance if there are any exits you haven’t explored yet.  If you get
stuck, you can scan your map for any unexplored areas, where you might find
what you’re looking for.

If the story doesn’t recognize a word or any of its synonyms, the object you’re
trying to manipulate probably isn’t important to the story.  If you try
manipulating something, and the story responds with something like “that isn’t
important,” you can probably just ignore the object; it’s most likely just
there as scenery, to make the setting more detailed.

If you’re trying to accomplish something, and nothing you do seems to work, pay
attention to what’s going wrong.  If everything you try is met with utter
dismissal (“nothing happens” or “that’s not something you can open”), you might
simply be on the wrong track; step back and think about other ways of
approaching the problem.  If the response is something more specific, it might
be a clue.  “The guard says ‘you can’t open that here!’ and snatches the box
from your hands” — this might indicate that you have to get the guard to leave,
or that you should take the box somewhere else before you open it, for example.

If you get completely stuck, you might try setting aside the current puzzle and
working on a different problem for a while.  You might even want to save your
position and take a break from the game.  The solution to the problem that’s
been thwarting your progress might come to you in a flash of insight when you
least expect it, and those moments of insight can be incredibly rewarding.
Some stories are best appreciated when played over a period of days, weeks, or
even months; if you’re enjoying the story, why rush through it?

Finally, if all else fails, you can try asking for help.  A great place to go
for hints is the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction.
