  Ivory— Horn— Ivory— You push on the gates separating you from your beloved, but
they do not budge.

Darkness— Light— Darkness— Colors gleam and fade as her wardrobe runs the
gamut, but she remains pale and lifeless.  Though she is a statue carved by
your own hand, you love her more than anything.  If only she could live and
love you too.

You pound again on the ivory gate, and as you do—

You awake in your studio.  Perhaps this is the day your prayers will be
answered.

Studio Entrance
Your studio is where you create great works of art, though you have made
nothing since you carved that statue.  This corner, which now serves as your
bedroom and dining room, is the entrance to the building.  A door leads
outside, and the studio itself is to the north and the east.

You see a camp bed and an end table (on which are a bottle of wine, a plate of
chopped liver, and a coin box) here.

At the Workbench
This workbench, in the northwest part of the studio, was where you would create
works of art.  Now you just come here to contemplate your creation’s beauty,
dress her up, ply her with gifts, and lament your hopeless situation.

The statue stands on a plinth beside the workbench.

You see a stool here.  On the workbench are a gold nugget, a needle, a chisel,
and an idol.

>get pearls
Taken.

At the Altar
Light from the window illuminates a crude altar.  Until recently, this area was
the gallery where customers would buy your art; all that is gone now.  The rest
of the studio lies north and west.

A pole sticks out of a wicker cage and leans ithyphallically against the wall.

>put it on altar
Done.

>pray
(at the altar)
“O Aphrodite,” you say, “comforter of hopeless lovers, hear my prayer!  May she
to whom I have given my heart be given body, soul, and life.  And a colorful
personality.  And—”

You are interrupted by a shimmering about the altar.  As you watch, it takes
the form of a callipygian goddess.

“Mortal, I have heard your heart-felt and oft-repeated plea, and I will take
pity on you,” says Aphrodite.  “If you give me a token of your love as an
offering, I will give you the [[keyword]] of life.  Speak this word in the
presence of a mirror, and I will grant your request.”

She fades away, adding, “As for her colorful personality, just look around
you.”

(at the altar)
Aphrodite reappears.  “A necklace!  Perfect!”  The necklace disappears in a
bright flash.  When your eyes readjust, you see a bronze key lying in its
place.

>get key
Taken.

Washroom
Sculpting is a dusty business.  You use this sink to clean off after a hard
day’s work.  Beside the sink is a small side table, and on the wall is a
calculator.  The rest of the studio is south and west.

On the side table are a manual and a comb.

>c +20000
The calculator outputs +20000 = 20000.  Water flows from the faucet, filling
the sink.

>wash
(the bronze key)
You clean the bronze key, revealing an inscription.

>c 1/0
The calculator outputs [[ERROR]] {division by zero}.  The water in the sink is
sucked down the drain.

Portico
Columns line the portico stretching east and west, and steps lead down to the
south.  The door leads back in, and beside the door is a basin.  A [[label]] is
affixed to the doorpost.

A bird flies in through the columns and alights in the basin.

(Your score has just increased by one point.)

>x all
bronze key: It is a bronze key.  On it is etched the word “rhimon”.

basin: It is shallow but wide, and lined with black tiles.  It grows gradually
deeper towards a decorative vase in the center.  It used to be a fountain, but
it stopped working after they installed the new sink.  Something to do with
water pressure, no doubt.  Now you just use it as a birdbath.

It is full to the brim with water.  You can see your reflection, though it is
distorted by the ripples issuing from the bird.

An iron key is lodged in the drain.

The bird flutters around the basin.

bird: It’s a turtle-dove: an auspicious omen!

door: It is a simple wooden door.  It’s open.

columns: There are six slender columns with scrollwork in the capitals.  Above
the architrave is a frieze depicting some of your wares.  The cornice overhangs
the frieze a bit too much, you think; perhaps you should shorten it.  You try
to concentrate on the architecture of the portico, stoically ignoring what you
cannot change, but it doesn’t work.  It never does.

label: The label says “Pygmentalion” (which is your [[name]]).

(Your score has just increased by one point.)

>get key
You take the iron key.

Light from the window illuminates a crude altar.  Until recently, this area was

of the studio lies north and west.

A pole sticks out of a wicker cage and leans ithyphallically against the wall.

>l in net
(first opening the wicker cage)
At one end of the pole is a bag.  The bag contains a mallet and a ball-peen
hammer.

net: The ball-peen hammer is too big for the bag to fit through the bars.

ball-peen hammer: Taken.

Portico
Columns line the portico stretching east and west, and steps lead down to the

affixed to the doorpost.

The bird is startled and hops to the far side of the basin.

>put bird in net
You swipe at the bird with the net but it darts out of the way.  It flaps
noisily out of the portico, through the columns and away towards the west.

>rhimon
The air above the basin shimmers for a moment.  You hear footsteps behind you.
Turning around, you see a woman who looks remarkably like your statue.

“Hello, world,” she says.  “It’s nice to be alive at last!  Hello, dearest
Pygmentalion.”

Ah, what beauty!  What mastery of syntax!  Praise be to Aphrodite!
